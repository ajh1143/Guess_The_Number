# Mystery_Number_Game

Relatively simple game where the user guesses the randomly generated 'secret' number based on a range that the user defines. The user will create a profile with a unique ID based on their entered
name. 

The created profile will track the number of guesses, total wins, and calculate ratios and average guesses per wins.

Hints will be given in the form of 'higher'/'lower' suggestions from the cpu.
